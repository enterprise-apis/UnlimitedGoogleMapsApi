# UnlimitedGoogleMapsApi
Get unlimited use of the google maps platform API for $500 a month or pay 1/6 the price of the pay per use model

We've put together a lightning fast enterprise grade API that mimics the google maps api in full (you code can stay exactly the same) but allows you to make unlimited use of the endpoints for a fixed fee of $500 a month.

If you're looking for an alternative to the google maps api so you can control your costs, this is probably your best option. Google's data quality is hard to beat, and you can now access it for an affordable price.

If your use case inovlves fewer requests but you'd still like to save a bundle relative to the official google maps api, check out the pay per use version here: https://rapidapi.com/unbundling-search-unbundling-search-default/api/google-maps28
